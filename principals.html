                <p>McNally provides an inspiring and dynamic academic environment with a long history of 
                excellence in languages, athletics, community involvement, career and technology studies, 
                and fine arts. Our students work in an inclusive environment, utilizing a range of resources
                and technologies to develop foundational knowledge, skills and attitudes across different 
                subject disciplines and to foster international-mindedness. Four programs are currently 
                offered within McNally High School: Regular; International Baccalaureate Diploma and 
                Certificate; Interactions; and Community Learning Skills (CLS). Students can pursue 
                a variety of courses provided in core instruction and additional courses such as: 
                Construction, Computer Science, Multimedia, Food Studies, Physical Education, 
                Medical Studies, Community Care and Sports Performance. Students may also take
                Fine Arts offerings such as Art, Dance, Drama, Musical Theatre, and Band. Language 
                instruction, for our students, is available in English, French, Mandarin, and Spanish.</p>

<p>Our curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular programming ensures a positive environment 
conducive to fostering school spirit, international mindedness, service work, student leadership 
(IB-CAS), and commitment to high standards for student conduct. McNally Tiger Pride is alive 
throughout the hallways of our school in recognition of our academic achievements, champion 
sports teams, community service work, and other student accomplishments. We also have a comprehensive
Fitness Centre and onsite athletic therapist and wellness coach to support our school’s emphasis on 
comprehensive health and athletics programming. At McNally, our commitment to our students is embodied
in our school motto - Nihil Sed Optimum - Nothing but the Best. The faculty and students of McNally
strive to live up to this motto each and every day.</p>

<p>At McNally, we are committed to assisting our students in planning for their future. Our Student 
Learning Services team can help guide you as you prepare for post-secondary education, and the world 
of work through our Work Experience and RAP programming. Many opportunities exist in career pathways 
and student leadership to prepare our students to become responsible citizens and contributing members
of our communities.</p>

McNally your choice next year! You belong here!</p>
