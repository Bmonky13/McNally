                <h1>SECOND LANGUAGES</h1>
                
                <p>McNally high school offers a variety of second langage courses. These include: French, Spanish,
                and Mandarin. 
                
                <h2>French:</h2>
                
                <p>Students who have taken Fench in the later years of elementry, and throughout junior high can 
                select the french 9-year course. This course accounts for a student's previous french education
                and starts with a brief review period to ensure students are at, or near, the same level. Then, 
                students are taught increasingly complex verbiage and practice both their reading and writing 
                skills, as well as their speaking skills, in the french language. Many projects and collaberative 
                oportunites insure learning French is as fun as it can be!</p>
                
                <h2>Spanish:</h2>
                
                <p>It is assumed that a majority of students who are enrolled in the Spanish as a Second Language
                program have little to no previous experience. This is the reason McNally Highschool only offers a 
                spanish 3-year program. Students explore spanish culture in an engaging manner. Utilizing games and 
                co-operative projects, students start by learning the basic structure and format of the Spanish Language.
                Eventually students will gain the knowledge and confidence to both write and converse in Spanish!</p>
                
                <h2>Mandarin:</h2>
                
                <p>McNally historically offered a very popular mandarin program. However, due to recent phasing 
                out of this exceedingly complex Mandarin program, dwindling interst has been witnessed. Despite 
                this, McNally continues to offer an engaging course which teaches the mandarin language. Students 
                are first taught simple words and phrases to help them navigate the language at a novice level. As 
                students progress through the porgram, they begin to learn scentance structure and more advanced 
                words.</p>
